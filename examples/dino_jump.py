'''
Instructions:
0. Install pynput e.g. pip install pynput
1. Run python dino_jump.py - This launches the training tool.
2. Click on the pygame window thats opened to make sure windows sends the keypresses to that process.
3. Relax the Myo arm, and with your other hand press 0 - This labels the incoming data as class 0
4. Make a fist with your hand and press 1, to label the fist as 1.
5. Try making a closed and open fist and watching the bars change.
6. Once you've gathered enough data, exit the pygame window. This saves the data in data/vals0.dat and vals1.dat
7. If you make a mistake and wrongly classify data, delete vals0 and vals1 and regather
8. If your happy it works, change TRAINING_MODE to False.
9. Goto https://trex-runner.com/ and rerun dino_jump.py with TRAINING_MODE set to false.
10. Click in the brower to start the game and tell windows to send keypresses there
11. Try making a fist and seeing if the dino jumps

If it doesn't work, feel free to let me know in the discord:
